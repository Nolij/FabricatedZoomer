# Fabricated Zoomer

This is a fork of [EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL)'s [Ok Zoomer](https://github.com/EnnuiL/OkZoomer). It is meant to be a bug-for-bug port that simply allows this mod to work on Fabric loader as it originally did, and removes the "PMW" protest screen as it isn't needed anymore. I created this with no ill intent, I simply don't want to use Quilt Loader and I haven't found a good enough alternative to Ok Zoomer that supports Fabric.

## Download

I currently have not published this mod to CurseForge or Modrinth as I do not want to make profit from this, and if I ever do, [EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL) is free to reach out and request any monetization money the mod page(s) accumulate (which I will not be cashing out). Send donations to [EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL). This is her mod.

Please only use this mod on the Fabric Loader. It did technically work on the Quilt Loader in my testing, but as this is a bug-for-bug port you really should just use the upstream version.

Currently, I do not have access to a Maven, so GitHub Actions isn't capable of using the [Fabricated LibZoomer](https://github.com/Nolij/Fabricated-LibZoomer) dependency. As such, for the time being, you will have to build this mod for yourself if you wish to use it, as I don't care to manually create releases.
