# Fabricated Zoomer

This is a fork of [EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL)'s [Ok Zoomer](https://github.com/EnnuiL/OkZoomer). It is meant to be a bug-for-bug port that simply allows this mod to work on Fabric loader as it originally did, and removes the "PMW" protest screen as it isn't needed anymore. I created this with no ill intent, I simply don't want to use Quilt Loader and I haven't found a good enough alternative to Ok Zoomer that supports Fabric.

## Download

This mod is available for download on [CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabricated-zoomer) (where [EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL) receives 100% of monetization earnings).

If you wish to build this mod for yourself, you will also need to build the [Fabricated LibZoomer](https://github.com/Nolij/Fabricated-LibZoomer) dependency and publish it to your local maven.
